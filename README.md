Shiny App For Plotting Noise

In this App, the below mentioned types of noise can be plotted.

* Uniform Random Generator - It uses Linear congruential generator
* Normal Random Generator
* Rayleigh Random Generator

An initial seed is used to generate random numbers.

If no check box is selected, by default Uniform Random Generator 
will be plotted.

Sigma can be used to change the magnitude of the noise 
generated through Rayleigh Method.
